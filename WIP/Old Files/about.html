				<p>Hi everyone! My full name is Sir Tubias Pascal of Selby, but you can call me Pascal. I'm two years old, I have a cream coat with biege spots, and the smooshiest face. People always ask me what breed I am and honestly nobody knows, my dad says I'm a mutt just like him!</p>

				<p>I'm originally from Tennessee, or at least that's where my rescue found me. We had a big farm to play on down there until we could find our furever home. They called me Turbo back then, and I had a friend named Scout. We were told we were gonna go on an adventure to Canada at the start of 2020 but they closed the border! It took four months for us to get permission to finally cross over, and that's when we met my new parents.</p>

				<p>Tk and Jenny had chosen to foster me and my friend Scout in Toronto. We were super nervous at first, but I was quick to settle in. Unfortunately Scout realised he wasn't a city dog and missed the farm we had in Tennessee, so at the end of our foster he went to find a new human with the biggest yard we'd ever seen. I however decided to stay with my new humans and failed my fostering with flying colours! And to celebrate, they gave my new name!</p>

				<p>Since then we've had lots of adventures, I made lots of pals, and even graduated from doggy training school. Our most recent adventure has been moving us down to New York for Jenny's work and Tk's school. It was a lot of stress, and I didn't like leaving everything behind, but I think we're really starting to settle in here. They've both been out a lot more though as the lockdown has eased up, so I've been sure to give them lots of cuddles to show I've missed them</p>

				<p>So yeah, that's me! I hope you enjoy my website, and don't forget to follow me on Insta for all the latest updates. And if you want to buy me a treat, just let me know.</p>

					<h2>Tk Cram</h2>
					<p>This is my dad Tk (He's the one who made me this website). He's from New Zealand originally and I really hope to visit one day! He's currently studying for his Masters so he must be super smart, but all I know is it means he's out all day and I miss him lots. But sometimes he comes back with pig's ears or duck's heads so it's not all bad!</p>

					<p>And here's my mom Jenny. She helped with the website too, but only when Tk got completely stuck. She makes websites for a living so was super good at finding the bug straight away, as all moms are. She's actually from New York originally so was mega excited when we moved back, but she still works from home to keep me company. She's the one who buys most of my toys, and always fixes them when I chew my way through them (oops...sorry Mom!).</p>
