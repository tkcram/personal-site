				<p>Kia ora, my name's Sebastian Tk Cram. I originally hail from Aotearoa/New Zealand. Throughout my life I've been privildeged to wear many hats. I've been a researcher working towards bettering the lives of people in the community. An activist marching for the rights I believe all people are owed. An entertainer taking the stage in front of thousands of people. And even a traveller circumnavigating the world.</p>

				<p>As an undergraduate I studied <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/degrees/maoritanga/overview" target="_blank">Māoritanga at Victoria University</a> and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/logic-computation.html" target="_blank">Logic & Computation at The University of Auckland</a>, before taking some time off to explore the world. Upon my return I began working full time for Katoa Ltd, an indigenous research and evaluation firm I had previously worked odd jobs for. It was there I was able to hone my analytics skills, working my way up from data entry and research gathering on topics ranging from sexual health and wellbeing through to recidivism, to providing research insights on survey results amongst <a href="./reports.html#modal-renting" target="_blank">elder renters</a> and <a href="./reports.html#modal-mpei" target="_blank">students</a>, and eventually being co-authored on a paper about <a href="./reports.html#modal-awhi" target="_blank">giving and receiving help during the covid lockdowns</a>.</p>

				<p>I decided I should gain some more formal training as an analyst, and so I'm currently pursuing my <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/degrees/data-analytics-and-visualization-ms/" target="_blank">Masters of Science in Data Analytics and Visualization at the Pratt Institute</a> in Manhattan, New York. The program is giving me a wealth of wonderful opportunities to grow my existing skillset as well as adding many new skills to my repertoire. Many of the projects you will find on this site are the result of both my studies and my interests, including a <a href="./projects.html#modal-birdmap" target="_blank">NZ Bird Sighting Map</a>, a <a href="./projects.html#modal-dnd" target="_blank">DnD based web game</a>, and a website about <a href="./projects.html#modal-pascal" target="_blank">my dog</a>.</p>

				<p>Recently I've found myself settling down in New York City with my amazing partner <a href="http://www.cahalanejennifer.com/" target="_blank">Jenny</a> and magnificent mutt <a href="http://scram142.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Pascal</a>. The city has afforded me many opportunities, including finding some amazing friends to play boardgames and tabletop games with, stores such as <a href="https://www.lego.com/" target="_blank">Lego</a> and <a href="https://www.rizzolibookstore.com/" target="_blank">Rizzoli</a> to spend all my money, and <a href="https://www.aerialartsnyc.com/" target="_blank">Aerial Arts</a> where I get to spread my wings. <a href="https://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/" target="_blank">NYCC</a> is always a must, and I've spent many hours exploring the many incredible museums and parks.</p>
