				<!-- past personal -->
				<p>Kia ora, my name's Sebastian Tk Cram originally hailiing from Aotearoa/New Zealand. I've been privilidged to wear many hats during my life. I've been both a student and a teacher. A fool in a dress, and an activist protesting for the rights of my people. I've been tangata whenua and a traveller circumnavigating the world. I've been a singer, a dancer, and even a circus performer.</p>

				<!-- present personal -->
				<p>Recently I've found myself settling down in New York City with my amazing partner Jenny[link] and magnificent mutt Pascal [link]. The city has afforded me many amazing opportunities, including finding amazing friends to play boardgames and tabletop games with, stores such as Lego and Rizzoli to spend all my money, and Aerial Arts where i get to spread my wings. NYCC is always a must, and I've spent many hours exploring the many incredible museums and parks.</p>

				<!-- past professional -->
				<p>Although I hardly took the direct route to find myself here. In my undergraduate I studied Māoritanga at Victoria and Logic & Computation and The University of Auckland, before taking some time off to explore the world. Upon my return I began working full time for Katoa Ltd, an indigigenous research and evaluation firm I had previously worked odd jobs for. It was there I was able to hone my analytics skills, working my way up from data entry and research gathering on topics ranging from sexual health and wellbeing through to recidivism, to providig research insights on survey results amongst elder renters, and eventually being co-authored on a paper about giving and receiving help during the covid lockdowns. (You can see more of this on the publications panel)</p>

				<!-- present professional -->
				<p>I decided I should gain some more formal training as an analyst, and so I'm currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Data Analytics and Visualization at the Pratt Institute in Manhattan, New York. The program is giving me a wealth of wonderful opportunities to grow my existing skillset as well as adding many new skills to my repertoire. Many of the projects you will find on this site are the result of both my studies and my interests, including a NZ Bird Sighting Map, a DnD based web game, and a website about Pascal.
