				<p>Kia ora! My name's Sebastian Te Kahuturehu Cram, or just call me <b>Tk</b>. I'm a Data Analyst hailing from Aotearoa/New Zealand, currently in NYC living my best life. Here's a few things about me:</p>
				<!-- Kinda want seven things. Education, Family, Circus, and Travel all seem sound. Gaming seems appropriate, although not sure how to break it down. Collecting is kind of a vague topic, and no idea if costuming is relevant-->
				<ul>
					<li><p>I have a BSc in <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/logic-computation.html" target="_blank">Logic & Computation</a> from The University of Auckland and am working towards an <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/degrees/data-analytics-and-visualization-ms/" target="_blank">MSDAV</a> at Pratt.</p></li>
					<li><p>I'm engaged to the phenomenal <a href="http://www.cahalanejennifer.com/" target="_blank">Jenny Cahalane</a> and we have a magnificent mutt <a href="http://scram142.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Sir Tubias <b>Pascal</b> of Selby</a>.</p></li>
					<li><p>I used to perform for the circus, specialising in partner acrobatics and trapeze. These days I train at <a href="https://www.aerialartsnyc.com">Aerial Arts NYC<a>.</p></li>
					<li><p>I've circumnavigated the earth! Some favourtite places include Tokyo, Venice, Berlin, and NYC.</p></li>
					<li><p>I've been doing a lot of reading recently on birds, mythology, and bird mythology.</p></li>
					<!-- <li><p>I love collecting things including Pokémon (I caught 'em all), LEGO, bonsai, and butterflies.</p></li> -->
					<!-- <li><p>I have been known to dress up in silly costumes for LARPs and cons. Currently working on a Mr. Knight cosplay for NYCC.</p></li> -->
					<li><p>I play a lot of Hearthstone, and have hit Rank 1 Legend! Minecraft, Civilization, and XCOM are some of my other favourites.</p></li>
					<li><p>I enjoy running TTRPG campaigns in systems such as Dungeons & Dragons and The Chronicles of Darkness.</p></li>
<!-- 				<p>Kia ora, my name's Sebastian Tk Cram and I hail from Aotearoa/New Zealand. As an undergraduate I studied <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/degrees/maoritanga/overview" target="_blank">Māoritanga at Victoria University</a> and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/logic-computation.html" target="_blank">Logic & Computation at The University of Auckland</a>. After graduation I took some time off to explore the world, and backpacked around the United States and Canada. When I returned home I began working full time for Katoa Ltd, an indigenous research and evaluation firm. There I cultivated an interest in data and analytics, from data entry and research gathering on topics including sexual health and recidivism, to providing research insights on survey results amongst <a href="./reports.html#modal-renting" target="_blank">elder renters</a> and <a href="./reports.html#modal-mpei" target="_blank">students</a>. I was also named as a co-author on a paper about <a href="./reports.html#modal-awhi" target="_blank">giving and receiving help during the Covid lockdowns</a>.</p>

				<p>Eventually, I realised I should pursue more formal training as an analyst, and now I'm currently working towards my <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/degrees/data-analytics-and-visualization-ms/" target="_blank">Masters of Science in Data Analytics and Visualization at the Pratt Institute</a> in New York. The program has provided a wealth of wonderful opportunities to both grow my existing skillset and learn many new tools. Many of the projects you will find on this site are a combination of both my studies and my interests, including a <a href="./projects.html#modal-birdmap" target="_blank">NZ Bird Sighting Map</a>, a <a href="./projects.html#modal-dnd" target="_blank">DnD based web game</a>, and a website about <a href="./projects.html#modal-pascal" target="_blank">my dog</a>.</p>

				<p>Now I'm settling into NYC with my amazing partner <a href="http://www.cahalanejennifer.com/" target="_blank">Jenny</a> and magnificent mutt <a href="http://scram142.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Pascal</a>. Here I've found some amazing friends to play boardgames and tabletop games with, stores such as Lego and Rizzoli to spend all my money, and a place where I get to soar through the air on the trapeze. -->
